# Takeout Configuration

The Takeout server has a server configuration file and media specific
configuration files, one per media sub-directory. The configuration file
formats are parsed using [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) so formats
like JSON, TOML and YAML can be used. YAML is used in most examples unless
stated otherwise.

## Server Configuration

Most of these are defaults and are here as an example only.

```
server:
  listen: :3000

auth:
  maxAge: 24h
  secureCookies: true
  DB:
    Driver: sqlite3
	Source: auth.db
	Logger: default

progress:
  DB:
    Driver: sqlite3
	Source: progress.db
	Logger: default

activity:
  DB:
    Driver: sqlite3
	Source: activity.db
	Logger: default
```

## Database Configuration

* Driver - Use "sqlite3", it's super fast and builtin
* Source - Name of database file
* Logger - Use debug, default or discard

You can try mysql if you'd like. It has worked in the past but it's not tested
much.

* Driver: "mysql"
* Source: "takeout:takeout@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/mydb"

## Bucket Configuration

See the included [config.yaml](config.yaml) example configuration. This
configuration file must be included in each media sub-directory. The file
specifies the bucket details along with movie and video metadata configuration.

## Artists File

When you run into trouble matching artist names to MusicBrainz artists, this
file can save the day. You'll need this when there are artists with the same
name and you want a specific one, artists with ambiguous names or for some
reason or another Takeout just can't figure it out. Create an artist file like
this:

```
{
    "Belly" : "c118bc97-11a7-41dc-a55e-48c3bcf22ac2",
    "POW!" : "e00ac97d-3ed1-4f3e-86e1-1b15dd3ad6ad",
    "Phoenix" : "8d455809-96b3-4bb6-8829-ea4beb580d35",
    "Isao Tomita" : "9119e57f-1086-48b2-8a93-57feacb7f6d9",
    "Organisation _ Kraftwerk" : "7b6de1a2-d119-48a6-a17c-5472df12beeb",
    "Kid Rock & The Twisted Brown Trucker" : "ad0ecd8b-805e-406e-82cb-5b00c3a3a29e",
    "R.E.M_" : "ea4dfa26-f633-4da6-a52a-f49ea4897b58",
    "Gary Numan & Ade Fenton" : "6cb79cb2-9087-44d4-828b-5c6fdff2c957",
    "Sonic Youth, I.C.P. & The Ex" : "5cbef01b-cc35-4f52-af7b-d0df0c4f61b9",
    "The Vines" : "4e045c96-538b-46ed-8ea8-7cae20b56574",
    "CHVRCHÎžS" : "6a93afbb-257f-4166-b389-9f2a1e5c5df8",
}
```

```

Movies can be recommended based on date patterns and search queries. It's a
convenient way to watch movies without having to think too hard while you sit
on the sofa. There many recommendations included in the builtin
configuration. Add your own as shown below. Note that the Layout field
corresponds to Go's clever yet funky [date parsing layouts](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants).

```
video:
  Recommend:
    When:
	  - Name:   "Friday the 13th Movies"
	    Match:  "Fri 13"
	    Layout: "Mon 02"
		Query:  +character:voorhees
      - Name:   "Star Wars Day"
	    Match:  "May 04"
	    Layout: "Jan 02"

		Query:  +keyword:christmas
```
